1. More harsh death penalties:
	- You lose all your gold
	- If you resurrect in town, you lose 100% experience
	- If you resurrect in dungeon, you lose 150% experience
	- If you resurrect in place, you lose 200% experience
	- Fame stays the same

	- 10% initial disenchant chance
	- +10% disenchant increase chance for each enchant

5. Unusable items are red, unidentified items are yellow.

6. Greatly increased cost of spells and potions.

7. Progressive stat and skill points (search for ProgressivePoints mod), but not fame levels
